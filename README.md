# Credit-card-fraud-detection-analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset related to the analysis of credit card fraud detection. The Jupyter Notebook includes code written in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess the data, analyze it, and then visualize it detecting fraudulent transactions.
## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn). The Jupyter Notebook contains code for data preprocessing, data analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains credit card transactions with features such as transaction amount, time (in seconds), and anonymized variables.

I have provided the dataset that I used for analysis [creditcard.xlsx]

## Methodology
- Data Collection: 
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance.

## Code
I have provided The Jupyter Notebook:[Credit Card Craud Detection Analysis.ipynb] contains the Python code for data preprocessing, data analysis, and visualization.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates an effective analysis for detecting credit card fraud.

## Future Work
- Investigate advanced anomaly detection techniques.
- Implement real-time fraud detection systems.
- Explore the impact of additional features on model performance.
