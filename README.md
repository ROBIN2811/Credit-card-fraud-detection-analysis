# Credit-card-fraud-detection-analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset related to the analysis of credit card fraud detection. The Jupyter Notebook includes code written in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess the data, analyze it, and then visualize it detecting fraudulent transactions.
## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an effective credit card fraud detection analysis. By analyzing historical credit card transaction data, we aim to identify patterns and anomalies associated with fraudulent activities.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, timestamp, merchant information, and other relevant attributes. The dataset contains a mix of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

I have provided the dataset that I used for analysis [creditcard.xlsx]

## Methodology
- Data Collection: 
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance.

## Code
I have provided The Jupyter Notebook:[Credit Card Craud Detection Analysis.ipynb] contains the Python code for data preprocessing, data analysis, and visualization.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates an effective analysis for detecting credit card fraud.

## Future Work
- Investigate advanced anomaly detection techniques.
- Implement real-time fraud detection systems.
- Explore the impact of additional features on model performance.
